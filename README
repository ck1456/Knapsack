The attached zip file contains all of the source and compiled code to produce solutions

Copy the zip file to an energon machine and unzip:
> unzip SackFiller.zip
> cd SackFiller

The SackFiller.jar in this directory is the tool used to generate solutions.
You can invoke it with two command line arguments <input> <output>:
> java -Xmx1g -jar SackFiller.jar sample_1_0.in sample_1_0.out

*** NOTE *** : For many instances of the problem we trade memory space
for execution speed and it is necessary to allocate a bit more memory to
the java heap in order facilitate this.  The "-Xmx1g" argument to java is required.

If necessary you can rebuild the jar file by using the included ant build script:
> ant clean
> ant

Other Helpful Hints:
We also supplied an automation script which can generate results for all problem sets
and evaluate the results.  Assuming that all of the inputs are in:
    data/
and that the evaluator program is located at:
    spec/evaluator

Then you can run:
$ chmod 755 test_and_score_all.sh
$ chmod 755 spec/evaluator
$ test_and_score_all.sh
This will store solutions in soln/ and output results for each test.
